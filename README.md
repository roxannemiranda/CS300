The academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABCU assigned me to build a program to advise and assist with course information. The program was to provide a menu for users interested in computer science courses. This project dealt with different data structures to understand the structure needed for the project. While coding this program I experienced errors while testing the program. I approach this problem with an understanding to better practice in debugging, and continuously fixing the errors in this program. Using data structures keeps your program organized, this allows for functions within your system to run faster. Data structures give a better understanding how the code runs and make it easier for modifications and adjustments. This project gave me a really good understanding of how data structures are used in programming. With this project, I will practice my use of data structures in programming for future uses.
